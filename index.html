<h1>My Experience in HTML</h1><br>
<h2>My Coding Journey</h2>
<p>Hello my name is Abdul Shakur.And i'm writing about my experience in learning web programming in the last 2 weeks.I started with the freecodecamp courses the lecturer gave us earlier.It served as a headstart for my html journey and helped me hone my html skills.I also watched a couple of youtube videos to help me understand some stuff i didnt get clearly during the course.Our lecture encoouraged us to learn with the frecodecamp and we had occasional zoom scrum meeetings to share our problems and also our progress in the course as well.For the hosting,i used github since i was familiar with that one. So i created a repository and copied a couple of projetcs and did some skirmishes before i uploaded it to github. </p>
